# Familiar Weapons
Adds a few pieces of equipment that are Minecraft-ified versions of weapons from other media.

- Ankh Shield: Cures negative effects while in hand
- Elegant Reaper's Scythe: A scythe that can summon wither skulls. Also works as a hoe
- Light Arrow: an upgraded Spectral Arrow that has Piercing IV by default and can pierce single-block walls (this is a little jank)
- Plasma Sword: A sword that ignores armor but deals no knockback
- Glove(s) of Urgency: Gloves that make you run faster
- Possibly more to come!

All weapons have support for Better Combat weapon attributes, and if you want to Dual-Wield Gloves of Urgency then you will need that mod.
All weapons are craftable by default, but I encourage you to change the method of obtaining to your liking.

For both Fabric and Forge. Requires Architectury API.

## Personal note
This is more of a fun little "let's learn Architectury" project than one meant to be included in modpacks. 
Also, I know I spelled Architectury wrong in the repo title. Oh well.
